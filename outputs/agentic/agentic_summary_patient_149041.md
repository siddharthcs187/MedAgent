* **Complaint:**  Insufficient data provided to determine the presenting complaint.  The available data suggests a complex medical picture involving cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal issues.


### Clinical Findings

Creatinine: 1.48 mg/dL (989 min). Bicarbonate: 28 mmol/L (989 min). Anion gap: 12 mmol/L (989 min). Glucose: 102 mg/dL (989 min), 85 mg/dL (133 min). BUN: 28 mg/dL (989 min).

* **Labs (Patient 167186):** Chloride: 105 mmol/L (-236 min post unit admission). Calcium: 9.2 mg/dL (-236 min). Glucose: 99 mg/dL (-236 min). Anion gap: 12 mmol/L (-236 min). Creatinine: 1.29 mg/dL (-236 min). Sodium: 141 mmol/L (-236 min). BUN: 25 mg/dL (-236 min). Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L (-236 min). Bicarbonate: 28 mmol/L (-236 min).  Note that time points are inconsistent across reports.

* **Imaging:** Images provided are illegible and do not contribute to the clinical findings.

* **Diagnoses (Patient 167186):** Primary: Cardiovascular post vascular surgery/s/p interventional vascular procedure. Major: COPD (ICD-9 codes: 491.20, J44.9) and Chronic Kidney Disease (ICD-9 codes: 585.9, N18.9).


### Summary & Recommendations

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a complex medical history, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal issues.  The available data is fragmented and incomplete, making a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan impossible.  The reports suggest a post-operative state following a vascular procedure, complicated by COPD and chronic kidney disease.  Lab values show some abnormalities, notably elevated creatinine, suggesting renal impairment.  The glucose levels are somewhat inconsistent between tests.  The lack of a detailed medical history, treatment information, and complete physical examination findings significantly limits the ability to provide comprehensive recommendations.

**To formulate a proper assessment and treatment plan, the following information is crucial:**

* **Complete medical history:**  Presenting complaint, duration of illness, past medical history, family history, social history, and medication history.
* **Detailed physical examination:**  Full documentation of the physical examination findings.
* **Comprehensive lab results:** A complete time series of lab values to establish trends and monitor changes.
* **Treatment details:**  A record of all administered treatments, medications, and interventions.
* **Imaging reports:**  If any imaging studies were performed, their reports are necessary for interpretation.

Without this additional information, any recommendations would be speculative and potentially harmful.  A thorough review of the patient's chart and a discussion with the treating physician are necessary to develop an appropriate care plan.
