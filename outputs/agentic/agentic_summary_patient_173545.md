**Medical Report - Patient 002-12056**

**1. Patient Overview**

* **Demographics:** Female, 47 years old, Caucasian.  Patient ID: 002-12056.  Hospital ID: 60; Ward ID: 83.
* **Complaint:**  Insufficient data provided to determine the presenting complaint.  Diagnoses suggest acute COPD exacerbation and acute respiratory failure.


**2. Clinical Findings**

**2.1 Hospital Course:** The patient was admitted to the hospital on an unspecified date in 2015 (Hospital Admit Time: 04:24:38), transferred from the floor.  She was admitted to the Med-Surg ICU (Unit Admit Time: varying times across different unit stays â€“  21:25:00 in one instance, 02:43:00 in another, and 02:41:00 in a third).  She was discharged to a Skilled Nursing Facility (Hospital Discharge Time: 19:00:00).  During her hospital stay, she had at least three separate unit stays (unit stay IDs 198627, 198629, and 198630), indicating potential transfers between units.  One unit discharge was to a Step-Down Unit (SDU).  Admission weight varied across different unit stays (41.7 kg, and 49.4 kg).  Discharge weight was 49.8 kg in one instance and 45.4 kg in another.


**2.2 Diagnoses:**

* **Primary:** Acute COPD exacerbation (ICD-9 Code: 491.21, J44.1)
* **Major:** Acute respiratory failure (ICD-9 Code: 518.81, J96.00)


**2.3 Treatments:** No treatment information is available.


**2.4 Vital Signs:** Insufficient data provided.  No vital sign trends are available.


**2.5 Laboratory Findings:**  Lab data is fragmented and incomplete across multiple unit stays.  Significant variations in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit levels are observed.

* **Unit Stay 198627:**  Initial Hemoglobin was 13.6 g/dL, decreasing to 11.7 g/dL and 11.8 g/dL before rising again to 12.9 g/dL.  Hematocrit followed a similar trend.  White blood cell counts fluctuated.  Electrolyte levels showed some variability, particularly potassium and sodium.  Blood gas analysis showed fluctuating PaO2 and PaCO2, suggestive of respiratory instability.
* **Unit Stay 198629:**  Hemoglobin dropped from 12.7 g/dL to 11.2 g/dL.  Hematocrit similarly decreased.  Platelets and WBC showed increases.  Elevated alkaline phosphatase, low albumin, slightly elevated glucose, and an elevated anion gap were noted.  An ABG showed metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.42, PaCO2 69 mmHg, HCO3 44 mmol/L, Base Excess 20 mEq/L).
* **Unit Stay 198630:** No lab data available.


**2.6 Microbiology:** No microbiology test results are available.


**2.7 Physical Examination:** Insufficient data provided.  Admission weight varied across different unit stays, with a maximum recorded weight of 49.4 kg.  One physical exam noted a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, indicating normal neurological function.


**3. Summary & Recommendations**

This patient presented with an acute exacerbation of COPD leading to acute respiratory failure, requiring admission to the Med-Surg ICU.  Significant fluctuations in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit levels, along with varying electrolyte imbalances and respiratory gas values, suggest an unstable clinical course requiring close monitoring. The significant drop in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit between lab draws in unit stay 198629 warrants further investigation into the cause, such as bleeding or hemolysis. The metabolic alkalosis in unit stay 198629 also requires further evaluation and consideration of potential underlying causes and treatment needs.

**Recommendations:**

* **Complete Medical History:** Obtain a thorough patient history including past medical history, presenting symptoms, family history, and social history to better understand the patient's condition and risk factors.
* **Complete Lab Data:**  Collect complete and consistent lab data across all unit stays for comprehensive analysis.
* **Vital Sign Monitoring:**  Implement continuous or frequent monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation) to track the patient's response to treatment.
* **Treatment Details:**  Document all treatments and interventions administered, including medications, respiratory support, and other therapies.
* **Detailed Physical Examination:**  Perform and document a thorough physical examination at each stage of the hospital stay.
* **Further Investigation:** Investigate the cause of the decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit and the metabolic alkalosis.


This report is limited by the incomplete and fragmented nature of the provided data.  A comprehensive assessment and appropriate management strategy require more complete information.
