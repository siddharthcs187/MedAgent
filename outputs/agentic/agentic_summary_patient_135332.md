**Stay 149433 (SICU, Unit Admit Time: 2015-XX-XX 07:31:00):** Bloodwork at -105 minutes pre-unit admission showed:  Hgb: 14.5 g/dL; Hct: 41.5 %; MCV: 91 fL; MCH: 31.8 pg; MCHC: 34.9 g/dL; RDW: 12.5 %; Platelets: 327 K/mcL; WBC: 9.3 K/mcL; RBC: 4.56 M/mcL;  Eosinophils: 1 %; Basophils: 0 %; Lymphocytes: 41 %; Monocytes: 9 %; Polymorphonuclear leukocytes: 49 %; Bicarbonate: 22 mmol/L; Chloride: 105 mmol/L; Sodium: 142 mmol/L; Potassium: 3.5 mmol/L; Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL; Glucose: 122 mg/dL; BUN: 16 mg/dL; Albumin: 3.7 g/dL; Total Protein: 7.3 g/dL; Total Bilirubin: 0.2 mg/dL; Direct Bilirubin: 0.1 mg/dL; Alkaline Phosphatase: 69 Units/L; ALT: 22 Units/L; AST: 12 Units/L; Anion Gap: 19 mmol/L; Acetaminophen: <2 mcg/mL; Salicylate: 3.3 mg/dL; Ethanol: 231 mg/dL.


**Imaging:** No relevant information provided.

**Microbiology:** No microbiology test results are available for either stay.

**Physical Examination:** No physical examination findings are provided for either stay.


### Summary & Recommendations

This report is limited by the incomplete data provided.  Crucial information, including the patient's chief complaint, admission diagnoses, treatment details, and vital signs, is missing.  Both stays (149432 and 149433) appear to be related to the same patient, with stay 149433 preceding stay 149432.  The available lab data shows some variation between the two stays, particularly in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts.  The presence of elevated ethanol (231 mg/dL) and salicylate (3.3 mg/dL) in stay 149433 is significant and requires further investigation to determine the cause (e.g., accidental or intentional ingestion).  The clinical significance of these findings, and their relationship to the patient's condition, cannot be determined without additional clinical information.

**Recommendations:**

1. Obtain complete medical records including the patient's chief complaint, admission diagnoses for both stays, detailed treatment plans, and complete vital sign trends.
2. Investigate the elevated ethanol and salicylate levels detected in stay 149433.  This may involve toxicology screening and further history taking to determine the circumstances of the exposure.
3. Correlate lab data from both stays with the patient’s clinical picture and treatment response to understand the overall clinical course.
4. Conduct a thorough review of the patient's medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries, allergies, and family history.
5. Perform a complete physical examination to assess the patient’s overall condition.  
6. Once complete data is available, a more comprehensive and accurate medical report can be generated.

==== Actionable Clinical Insights ====

- [ ] Obtain complete medical records for both hospital stays to clarify admission diagnoses, chief complaints, and treatment plans.
- [ ] Investigate the cause of elevated ethanol and salicylate levels in stay 149433, potentially through toxicology screening and additional history taking.
- [ ] Correlate lab data from both stays with the patient's clinical picture and treatment response.
- [ ] Conduct a thorough review of the patient's medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries, allergies, and family history.
- [ ] Perform a complete physical examination to assess the patient's overall condition.
- [ ] Generate a comprehensive and accurate medical report once complete data is available.
