==== Patient Summary ====

### Patient Overview

* **Demographics:** Female, 47 years old, Caucasian.  Patient Unit Stay ID: 163136 & 163137; Unique Patient ID: 002-10157. Hospital ID: 73; Ward ID: 93.  Admitted from another hospital.  Admission weight: 98.9 kg; Discharge weight: 98.8 kg (Patient 163137).  Admission height: 177.8 cm (Patient 163136).

* **Complaint:**  The precise complaint is not explicitly stated, but the diagnoses suggest the patient presented with alcohol withdrawal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy.


### Clinical Findings

**Patient 163136:**

* **Labs, Vitals:**  Two sets of lab results are available at 530 and 2028 minutes post-unit admission.  Hemoglobin (Hgb) showed a slight increase from 10.5 g/dL to 10.2 g/dL; Hematocrit (Hct) decreased slightly from 29.8% to 29.4%. White blood cell (WBC) count decreased from 7.6 K/mcL to 6.8 K/mcL. Platelets increased from 149 K/mcL to 163 K/mcL.  Differential showed changes in leukocyte percentages, with notable polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes.  Liver function tests (LFTs) showed a slight increase in total bilirubin (4.9 mg/dL to 5 mg/dL), AST (107 Units/L to 106 Units/L), and alkaline phosphatase (153 Units/L to 160 Units/L).  Anion gap increased slightly from 11 mmol/L to 12 mmol/L. Creatinine remained stable at 0.92 mg/dL. Glucose decreased from 99 mg/dL to 82 mg/dL.  Prothrombin time (PT) was 22.2 seconds with an INR of 2.2.  Ammonia was 30 mcg/dL.  Urinary specific gravity was 1.025.  Vitals and physical exam information are missing.


**Patient 163137:**

* **Labs, Vitals:** Lab data includes two chemistry panels (at approximately 506 and 1971 minutes post-unit admission) and a hematology panel at the same time points. Total bilirubin decreased from 5.2 mg/dL to 4.4 mg/dL. ALT remained elevated (32 Units/L to 29 Units/L). Albumin decreased from 1.7 g/dL to 1.5 g/dL. BUN decreased from 6 mg/dL to 5 mg/dL. Creatinine decreased from 1.19 mg/dL to 1.04 mg/dL. Calcium remained stable around 8 mg/dL. Alkaline phosphatase remained elevated. Chloride increased slightly. Anion gap decreased. Potassium improved. Glucose increased. Total protein decreased. Hemoglobin increased slightly from 9.8 g/dL to 10.7 g/dL. Platelets were low (99-101 K/mcL). PT and INR were elevated.  A physical exam at approximately 299 minutes showed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 23, indicating normal neurological function. Intake was 0 ml, output 50 ml.


### Summary & Recommendations

The patient presented with a complex clinical picture, primarily alcohol withdrawal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy, affecting multiple organ systems.  Both patients show signs of liver dysfunction (elevated bilirubin, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, decreased albumin), although there is some indication of improvement in liver function over time (Patient 163137).  Kidney function appears relatively stable, though mild abnormalities are present.  Hematological findings include mild anemia and low platelet counts (both patients), potentially related to the liver disease and alcohol abuse.  Coagulation is impaired, as evidenced by elevated PT and INR (Patient 163137).  The decrease in WBC count in Patient 163136 suggests possible resolution of infection or inflammation, but requires further investigation.  The information provided is incomplete, lacking crucial details such as medical history, detailed treatments, and vital signs trends.  A complete picture cannot be formed without this additional information.


**Recommendations:**

* **Complete Medical History:** Obtain a thorough medical history, including details of alcohol consumption, medication use, and any pre-existing conditions.
* **Detailed Treatment Plan:**  Review the patient's treatment plan to understand the interventions implemented for alcohol withdrawal, hepatic encephalopathy, and other diagnosed conditions.
* **Vital Sign Monitoring:**  Analyze the trends in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature) to assess the patient's overall stability and response to treatment.
* **Further Lab Investigations:**  Perform additional laboratory tests as needed to further evaluate liver function, coagulation status, and rule out other potential complications.  Consider tests for specific liver pathologies.
* **Nutritional Assessment:** Assess nutritional status due to potential malnutrition associated with alcohol abuse and liver disease.
* **Follow-up:**  Closely monitor the patient's response to treatment, with regular lab tests and clinical examinations to assess the progression of liver disease and overall recovery.
* **Consultations:** Consult with specialists (e.g., hepatologist, gastroenterologist) for further management and treatment recommendations.
* **Social Support:**  Assess the need for social support and rehabilitation programs to address the underlying alcohol abuse.


This report is based on limited data.  The conclusions drawn are preliminary and require further information for confirmation and refinement.
