**Medical Report: Patient 004-12627**

**1. Patient Overview**

* **Demographics:** 40-year-old Caucasian male.
* **Complaint:**  The initial complaint is not explicitly stated in the provided data.  However, the patient presented to the Emergency Department and was subsequently diagnosed with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).


**2. Clinical Findings**

* **Vitals:**  Limited vital sign data is available.  A physical exam at 245 minutes post-unit admission (stay 326251) revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, heart rate of 117 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 151/88 mmHg, and O2 saturation of 97% on 21% FiO2 with spontaneous respirations.  No other vital signs are recorded.
* **Labs:**  Several lab values are available from one time point (304 minutes post-unit admission in stay 326251): Glucose: 294 mg/dL; Sodium: 139 mEq/L; WBC: 14 K/mcL; Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL; Hct: 45.8%; BUN: 17 mg/dL.  FiO2 of 21% was measured at 41 minutes post-unit admission in stay 326250.  No trends are available due to the lack of serial measurements.
* **Imaging:** No imaging data is provided.
* **Hospital Course:** The patient was admitted to the hospital via the Emergency Department.  The patient had two unit stays:
    * **Stay 326249:**  Admitted to Med-Surg ICU from the Emergency Department, then transferred to a Step-Down Unit (SDU).  Discharged home.  Duration: ~ 7 minutes.  Very limited data available.
    * **Stay 326250:** Admitted to Med-Surg ICU from the SDU.  Discharged home.  Diagnosis of DKA, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were recorded 45 minutes post-unit admission. Treatments included promethazine, potassium and magnesium administration, and continuous insulin infusion.  These were initiated 45 minutes post-admission.  Physical exam at 42 minutes post-admission showed a GCS of 15, paced heart rhythm, and spontaneous respiration.
    * **Stay 326251:** Admitted to Med-Surg ICU from another ICU. Discharged to another ICU.  The diagnosis of DKA was recorded 26 and 326 minutes after unit admission. Treatments included magnesium and potassium administration, promethazine, and continuous insulin infusion â€“ none active at discharge.  A physical exam at 23 minutes post-admission was documented as "Performed - Structured," but the GCS was initially unobtainable due to medication. A subsequent exam at 245 minutes post-admission showed a GCS of 15, heart rate 117 bpm, respiratory rate 13, blood pressure 151/88 mmHg, and O2 saturation of 97% on 21% FiO2.  Lab results from 304 minutes post-admission are noted above.

**3. Summary & Recommendations**

Patient 004-12627 is a 40-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus who presented with DKA.  The patient received treatment for DKA, including electrolyte correction and insulin management.  The patient's hospital course involved multiple unit transfers.  The available data is fragmented and incomplete, limiting a comprehensive assessment.  

**Recommendations:**

* **Complete Medical History:** Obtain a complete medical history including details on past medical conditions, surgeries, allergies, medications, family history, and social history to better understand the context of this presentation.
* **Detailed Clinical Data:**  Obtain complete and serial data on vital signs, lab results, and physical examination findings to establish trends and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
* **Review of Imaging:** If any imaging studies were performed (e.g., chest x-ray, EKG), these should be reviewed.
* **Medication Reconciliation:**  A complete medication list including dosages and administration times is needed for a comprehensive understanding of the treatment course.
* **Further Investigation:**  Investigate the cause of the DKA and the reasons for the multiple unit transfers.
