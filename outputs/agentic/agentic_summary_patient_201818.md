**Medical Report: Patient 002-1105**

**1. Patient Overview**

* **Demographics:** Female, 69 years old, Caucasian.  Patient Unit Stay ID: 235042 and 235043 (separate stays implied by different IDs). Hospital ID: 60, Ward ID: 83.  Admission Height: 167.6 cm; Discharge Weight (at least one stay): 112.7 kg.

* **Complaint:**  No explicit complaint is provided in the available data.  The available data suggests a complex medical picture involving sepsis, pulmonary issues, and possible renal and liver dysfunction.


**2. Clinical Findings**

**2.1.  Hospital Course (Patient Unit Stay ID 235042):**

This stay involved a transfer from the ICU to an SDU, suggesting a critical initial condition.  The report indicates multiple blood tests were performed at various times relative to unit admission.  Significant lab abnormalities included:

* **Elevated Liver Enzymes:**  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) levels were consistently elevated (65-85 Units/L), suggesting liver injury.
* **Elevated BUN and Creatinine:** BUN (51-55 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.2-2.7 mg/dL) indicated renal dysfunction.
* **Low Albumin:** Albumin levels were consistently low (2.0-2.3 g/dL), suggesting possible malnutrition or liver/kidney disease.
* **Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase:** Consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (125-144 Units/L) suggests possible bone disease or liver dysfunction.
* **Anemia:** Low hemoglobin (10.8-12.4 g/dL) and hematocrit (31.6-36.6%) indicate anemia.
* **Elevated BNP:** Elevated BNP levels (147-388 pg/mL) suggest possible heart failure.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Fluctuations in potassium (3.2-3.8 mmol/L) and anion gap (15-18 mmol/L) indicate electrolyte imbalances.
* **Glucose Fluctuations:**  Significant fluctuations in glucose levels (32-194 mg/dL) were observed, indicative of possible glucose control issues.  Bedside glucose readings were frequently high (80s-190s mg/dL).


**2.2. Hospital Course (Patient Unit Stay ID 235043):**

This stay started on the floor and involved a transfer to the Med-Surg ICU.  The report highlights the following:

* **Renal Dysfunction:** Consistently elevated creatinine (3.2-3.3 mg/dL) and BUN (37-53 mg/dL) indicate ongoing renal dysfunction.
* **Liver Injury:** Elevated AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) levels initially (93 and 68 Units/L, respectively), decreasing slightly later, indicating liver injury.
* **Anemia:**  Low hemoglobin (10.6-11.5 g/dL) and hematocrit (31.3-35.1%) indicate anemia.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Potassium levels initially low (3.3 mmol/L), improved over time (3.5, 3.9 mmol/L).  Sodium, Chloride and Bicarbonate levels fluctuated within a relatively narrow range.
* **Low Albumin:**  Albumin was consistently low (1.9-2.5 g/dL), indicating possible protein deficiency.
* **Elevated WBC initially:**  Initially elevated WBC (7.5 K/mcL) decreased later (5.6 K/mcL), suggesting an inflammatory response.
* **Elevated Bilirubin initially:** Elevated initial bilirubin (1.9 mg/dL) decreased later (0.9-1.5 mg/dL).
* **Glucose Fluctuations:**  Glucose levels fluctuated (81-186 mg/dL).
* **Vitals:**  Vitals at 90 minutes post-admission during this stay showed a low blood pressure (95/59 mmHg), slightly elevated heart rate (76 bpm), and low respiratory rate (8 breaths/min).  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14 was documented.


**3. Summary & Recommendations**

The patient presents with a complex clinical picture involving sepsis, likely pulmonary complications, and significant renal and hepatic dysfunction.  Anemia is also present.  The fluctuating glucose levels suggest potential challenges with glucose control.  The elevated BNP suggests potential heart failure.

**Further investigations are required:**

* **Detailed history:**  To fully understand the patient's medical history, including the cause of sepsis and pulmonary issues.
* **Imaging studies:**  Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and potentially CT scans are necessary to assess the extent of pulmonary and other organ involvement.
* **Further lab tests:**  Consider additional tests to investigate the cause of the liver and kidney dysfunction, including liver function tests, renal function tests, and possibly a liver biopsy.  Further evaluation of electrolyte imbalances is necessary.
* **Cardiac evaluation:**  Given the elevated BNP, a thorough cardiac evaluation including an echocardiogram is recommended.
* **Nutritional assessment:**  Given low albumin, a comprehensive nutritional assessment is important to address possible malnutrition.
* **Review of medications:**  A complete review of the patient's medication list is needed to assess for any drug interactions or side effects contributing to the observed abnormalities.

This report is based on limited data.  A complete medical chart review and additional clinical information are crucial for a thorough assessment and development of a comprehensive treatment plan.
