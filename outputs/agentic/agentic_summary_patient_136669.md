==== Patient Summary ====

### Patient Overview

- **Demographics:** 59-year-old Caucasian female.  Admitted to the Med-Surg ICU on 2014-XX-XX at 17:06:00.  Height: 149.9 cm; Discharge Weight: 73 kg.  Unique Patient ID: 002-10079; Patient Unit Stay ID: 151179.

- **Complaint:**  The initial complaint is not explicitly stated in the provided data.  However, the patient presented with septic shock and multiple other significant diagnoses.

### Clinical Findings

- **Labs:**  The provided lab data shows significant fluctuation in multiple parameters over an unspecified timeframe.  Key observations include:
    - Hemoglobin (Hgb): Fluctuated between 12.0 g/dL and 14.5 g/dL.
    - Hematocrit (Hct): Varied between 37.7% and 43.3%.
    - White blood cell (WBC) count: Ranged from 14.1 K/mcL to 49.8 K/mcL, suggesting infection or inflammation.
    - Platelets: Varied between 296 K/mcL and 631 K/mcL.
    - Electrolytes: Significant variations in sodium (146 mmol/L at one point), potassium (3.5 mmol/L at one point), bicarbonate (20-24 mmol/L), chloride (113-119 mmol/L), calcium (6.0-6.2 mg/dL), BUN (26-37 mg/dL), creatinine (0.91 mg/dL at one point), and glucose (115-130 mg/dL) indicate potential electrolyte imbalances and organ dysfunction.  Anion gap was elevated (13-14 mmol/L).
    - Other blood tests:  MCH, MCV, MCHC, and RDW values show some variation, indicating potential abnormalities in red blood cell morphology.  Differential counts show variations in band neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, polys, and eosinophils.

- **Vitals:** Limited vital sign data is available. At one unspecified time point, heart rate was 125 bpm, blood pressure was 57/34 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 94%. Central venous pressure (CVP) was 11. Weight was 80.7 kg at one point. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15.


### Summary & Recommendations

The patient, a 59-year-old female, presented with septic shock (ICD-9 codes: 785.52, R65.21) as the primary diagnosis.  Other significant diagnoses included metabolic acidosis (276.2, E87.2), *C. difficile* colitis (008.45, A04.7), hypotension (458.9, I95.9), hypocalcemia (275.41, E83.51), moderate hypernatremia (276.0, E87.0, 146-155 mEq/dL), an infected pressure ulcer, and infectious dermatitis.  Metastatic lung cancer was listed as inactive upon discharge.

The patient's lab results reveal significant fluctuations in several parameters, indicative of multi-organ system dysfunction and a likely severe infection.  The elevated WBC count, along with the other lab abnormalities, strongly supports the diagnosis of sepsis.  The fluctuating Hgb and Hct suggest potential anemia, requiring further investigation.  Electrolyte imbalances are present, potentially contributing to the patient's condition.

The limited vital signs data shows evidence of hypotension and tachycardia at one point, consistent with septic shock. The GCS score of 15 indicates normal neurological function at that time.

**Critical Gaps in Information:** The provided data is severely incomplete, particularly lacking time-series data for vital signs and lab results.  Information on treatments administered and microbiology test results (cultures, sensitivities) is entirely absent.  This prevents a full assessment of the patient's course of illness, response to treatment, and the underlying cause of the sepsis.  A complete medical record, including a detailed medical history, a comprehensive timeline of events, and treatment details, is necessary for a proper evaluation of this case.  The patient expired, highlighting the severity of the situation and the need for a full investigation into the cause of death.

==== Actionable Clinical Insights ====

- Diagnosis refinement: Sepsis with associated complications such as infected pressure ulcer and C. difficile colitis.
- Immediate interventions: Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, IV fluids, vasopressors to manage hypotension, and close monitoring of vital signs.
- Further investigations: A complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, arterial blood gas analysis, blood cultures, urine cultures, stool cultures, and imaging studies as indicated to identify the causative organism(s) and assess the extent of organ damage.
- Potential referrals: Infectious disease specialist, gastroenterologist, wound care specialist, and palliative care team for pain management and end-of-life care discussions.
