### Patient Overview

- **Demographics:** 68-year-old female.
- **Complaint:** Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).


### Clinical Findings

- **Labs:**  WBC 11.2 x10³/µL (high), RBC 4.8 ×10⁶/µL, Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, Hematocrit 38%, ALT 78 U/L (high), AST 65 U/L (high), Alkaline Phosphatase 120 U/L (slightly high), Albumin 3.2 g/dL (low), Total Bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL (high), Prothrombin Time 13 seconds (high).
- **Vitals:**  None provided.
- **Imaging (CT):** Mild hepatomegaly without focal lesions. Liver showed mild enlargement and homogeneous attenuation.
- **Pathology (Liver Biopsy):** Three cores, tan-brown, 1.8 cm in length. Microscopy revealed mild portal inflammation, interface hepatitis. Diagnosis: Chronic hepatitis with steatosis (Grade 2, Stage 1).


### Summary & Recommendations

The patient is a 68-year-old female presenting with RUQ pain and elevated LFTs.  Laboratory results show elevated ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and prolonged PT, along with mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase and low albumin.  These findings, in conjunction with imaging showing mild hepatomegaly and the liver biopsy results indicating chronic hepatitis with steatosis (Grade 2, Stage 1), suggest a diagnosis of chronic liver disease. The elevated WBC count warrants further investigation to rule out infection.

**Recommendations:**

*   Further investigation is needed to determine the etiology of the chronic hepatitis and steatosis.  This could include additional serological testing for viral hepatitis (Hepatitis A, B, C), autoimmune hepatitis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
*   Assessment of potential risk factors for liver disease, such as alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, is crucial.
*   Monitoring of liver function through repeat LFTs and potential liver imaging at regular intervals is recommended.
*   Lifestyle modifications including dietary changes (potentially reducing saturated fat and sugar intake), weight loss if indicated, and avoidance of alcohol are advised.
*   Management of underlying conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) if present.
*   Consider referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for specialized care and management.
*   Follow-up blood tests to monitor the WBC count are warranted.
